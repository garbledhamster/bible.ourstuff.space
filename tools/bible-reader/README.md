# Private Project Bible reader updates

The reader checks the published Git revision at [version.json](https://bible.ourstuff.space/version.json) when the page opens. In **Get Started**, click the version above the title to check again or choose **Update now**. The short version is the first eight characters of the Git commit. Reload to pick up shared styles and resources after installing.

Serve a standard reader from its project root with Python 3 and Git:

```sh
python3 /path/to/bible.ourstuff.space/tools/bible-reader/serve.py \
  --port 8765 --directory docs --reader /reader/ docs/bible-upstream
```

Load `/_bible/updates.css` and `/_bible/updates.js` (a module) in each reader page. Use one `--reader URL_PATH SHARED_CHECKOUT` per reader. Readers that use the same checkout show the same installed version. A hosted reader can use `--mount /project/bible-upstream/ /path/to/project/docs/bible-upstream` to serve shared files from its project's checkout.

The updater checks Git for local changes and only checks out the published commit in the selected shared repository. It leaves the enclosing project Git history, Bible chapters, notes and assets in their current locations. Review the changed submodule pointer before recording it in the project repository. Keep the reader on localhost or a trusted private network.

Run the updater checks with `python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tools/bible-reader`.
